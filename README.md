## Creational Patterns
   - **Singleton Pattern** : Pattern to instantiate object once. 
   - **Factory pattern**: Instead of directly invoking object, use factory class by passing the type. The objects created by factory belong to same superclass. Factory class will have the logic to instantiate the class.
   - **Abstract Factory pattern**: Instead of having the instantiation in Factory class. Have Abstract factories for each type of sub classes. Facotry will only redirect to appropriate abstract factory class based on type. Abstract factory class will take care of instantiating object.
   - **ProtoType Desgin pattern**: Prototype pattern provides a mechanism to copy the original object to a new object and then modify it according to our needs. Prototype design pattern uses java cloning to copy the object. 
   
## Structural Design Patterns
   - **Adapter Pattern**:The adapter design pattern is one of the structural design patterns and itâ€™s used so that two unrelated interfaces can work together. 
   - **Composite Pattern**: When we need to create a structure in a way that the objects in the structure have to be treated the same way, we can apply the composite design pattern.
   - **Proxy Design pattern**: It is used when we want controlled access to a functionality.
